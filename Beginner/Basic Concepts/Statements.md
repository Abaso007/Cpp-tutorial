Semicolons
---
Each statement in C++ needs to end with a semicolon ;.

The code below contains an error. Fix it by adding a semicolon ; at the end of the statement, then run the code.
```
std::cout << "Coding is your new superpower"
```

Outputting a Text
---
When printing text outputs, you need to enclose the text in double quotes.
```
std::cout << "Level completed!";
```
><font color="#AE8E00">Your code will result in an error if you forget the quotes around the text.</font>

Text vs Numbers
---
Computers treat text and numbers differently. You don't need quotes when outputting numbers.
```
std::cout << 42;
```
