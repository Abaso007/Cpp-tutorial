 ### Coding

 Humans use computer programs to communicate with machines. Without computer programs, we wouldn't have smartphones, websites, or even exploration in outer space.

### Output

Most computer programs are designed to produce outputs. Here are some examples:

- "You've got a new message" notifications

- "Game Over" displayed on the screen when playing video games

- Your account balance when checking your online banking app.

The simplest output consists of displaying a message on the screen.

Coders use outputs all the time to check that the computer is following the given instructions and fix problems with code.

The following line of code displays "Welcome to C++" on the screen as an output:
```
cout << "Welcome to C++";
```
