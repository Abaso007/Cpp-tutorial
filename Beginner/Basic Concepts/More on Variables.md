Variables
---
You can declare variables of the same type on one line, separated by commas.
```
int x=8, y=2;
```
This makes the code shorter and also easier to read.

---
auto
---
Another handy keyword is auto.
The auto keyword allows you to set the type of the variable based on its value.
```
auto x = 4;
auto y = 3.37; 
auto z = "hello"; 
```

Naming Variables
---
C++ is case-sensitive.
For example, the name myvariable is not the same as MYVARIABLE and not the same as MyVariable. 
These are three different variables.

Naming Variables
---
Here are the rules for naming variables:
- All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore( _ ). 
- After the initial letter, variable names can contain additional letters, as well as numbers.
- Blank spaces or special characters are not allowed in variable names.

><font color="#AE8E00">There are two popular naming conventions: 
Pascal case: The first letter in the identifier and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word are capitalized. For example: BackColor
Camel case: The first letter of an identifier is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized. For example: backColor</font>

Lesson Takeaways
---
Great progress!
Here are some key points:
- You can declare multiple variables of the same type by separating them with commas.
- You can use the auto keyword to automatically set the type of the variable based on the value it's assigned to.
- Remember, that C++ is case sensitive.
- When naming your variables, remember that they need to start with a letter or underscore and cannot contain special symbols.
